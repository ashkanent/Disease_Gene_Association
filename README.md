# Disease_Gene_Association

- This methodology tries to find a pattern in the already known disease genes of genetic diseases and then tries to rank other genes in our genome based on their similarities to these patterns.
- This approach has successfully applied on breast cancer and Parkinson's disease. Some of the highly ranked genes (in the set of candidate disease genes) have been mentioned to be relevant to the diseases under study.
- The approach is based on genetic programming. It analyzes the centrality measures of known disease genes in the complex networks of gene interaction.
